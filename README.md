Testing website logging in via password

# Important-info
1. Information such as encryption key and encryption file are removed. If you wish to add your own encryption method and encrypted password, feel free to do so.

2. Example webpage is not functional, meaning that if you try to press the "submit" button then it won't do anything. The example website was stripped from https://mdnmapcheck.ddns.net/ if you wish to try it out. 

3. The example website on this is mine. I made it myself in my own time, so no illegal activity or easily discouraged practices are taking place.

4. I am aware that using hashes are better over encrypted passwords, I wasn't aware of this until after I had completed most of the back-end.
